# Observing waves, wind, and currents in the submesoscale range from Saildrone data

This work leaded by Jackson Krieger and supervised by Gwendal Marechal and Bia Villas BÃ´as in the context of the MURF Program.

To visualize the interactive plot of the **Significant Wave Height**, the **Dominant Wave Period**, the **Sea Surface Temperature**, the **Sea Surface Salinity**, the **Current Speed** and **Direction**, and the **Wind Speed** and **Direction**; download the .html file in the MURF_Mines_2024 repository. It is not possible, so far, to visualize the interactive plot straight from the GitHub interface.

From these interactive plots, you can **zoom** on a specific time window, **scroll** the whole dataset from the first observation to the last.
Oceanic currents are measured at different depth, you can **play** with the sliding bar to visualize the data from the surface down to one hundred meter deep.
